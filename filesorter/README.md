# Files-sorter
This Python script sorts files in a specified directory by categorizing them into subdirectories based on their file extensions. It defines a dictionary (files_types) mapping extensions to categories like "video," "audio," "documents," etc. The script validates that the dictionary is non-empty using a decorator (@check_dict), ensuring proper input before execution. It iterates through files in the given directory, moving them to corresponding subdirectories, while unmatched files are placed in an "others" folder. It automatically creates necessary directories and detects if any files remain unsorted, raising an error if sorting is incomplete. The script is executed via the command line with the argument --directory or --dir, specifying the folder to sort. If the directory does not exist, an error message is displayed. The sorted files are placed in a new directory named <directory>_sorted, organizing them by type. This script is useful for organizing downloads, project files, or cleaning up large mixed file collections.
